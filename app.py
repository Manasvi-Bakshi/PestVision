    st.write(""" **Introduction**:    
            Agricultural production faces a substantial challenge from pests, which inflict considerable harm to fruits and vegetables, impacting both crop quality and yield. To
            safeguard financial interests and ensure food availability, efficient pest management is crucial. In recent times, deep learning, particularly in the realm of computer vision, has
            shown remarkable promise in tackling these issues by enabling precise pest identification and categorization, even with limited datasets.  
            This study offers a thorough examination of the latest innovations in deep learning methodologies for identifying and categorizing pests in fruits and vegetables. The
            research explores various models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and few-shot learning approaches, which have proven effective in
            creating accurate pest recognition systems. Techniques like MobileNet CNN with autoencoder, ResNet-50, DM-YOLOv8, and enhanced versions of YOLOv7 and
            Cascade R-CNN have boosted detection capabilities. Additionally, methods such as PotatoPestNet, EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and LAD-Net, along with optimized pretrained CNN models, further enhance accuracy.  
            The study also delves into innovative strategies, including the use of YOLOv5 for UAV imagery, U-Net MobileNet combined with YOLOv5, and hybrid models that merge
            CNN architectures with majority voting. Other noteworthy techniques, such as IResNet with logistic regression, tiny YOLOv3 for drone-based images, VGG16, InceptionV3,
            and CNNs paired with SLIC SuperPixel segmentation, showcase the broad spectrum of deep learning applications in this field. These advancements contribute to the creation
            of more efficient, scalable, and accurate pest detection systems, which are vital for sustainable farming practices""")
